# Random-numbers

## What are random numbers and why do we need them?

Random numbers are numbers chosen by chance from a set of numbers completely by random. They are used for things like the lottery and gambling but also important stuff like computer encryption. 

## Random number generators and random numbers in Python

An algorithm which generates a random, or apparently random, sequence of numbers is called a random number generator.
Conditions: random number from a set of integers, all numbers have an equal chance of being chosen.

Random numbers in Python are generated by the randint() function. This is part of the random module which must be imported. 

E.g 
import random

n = random.randit(0,10)

print(n)

(Example will print a random number from 1-10)

## Deterministic random number generators

Deterministic - relating to the philosophical doctrine that all events, including human action, are ultimately determined by causes regarded as external to the will (being able to predict) e.g chess.

Real random numbers are not determinisic. 

## Shuffle 

The shuffle() function takes a list and shuffles it but does not return it. It does not create a new list but re orders a given sequence.
